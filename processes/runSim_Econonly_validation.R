    ## This is a "small" version of the runSim.R file that is designed to run just the Economic simulations (POSTasPOST for validation or POSTasPRE as a counterfactual)
    
   # in the mproc.txt file, you'll want to adjust the last few columns to run different scenarios.
      # set the EconData column to be the "stub" of the data you want to read in
      #  EconType=Multi --> a closure in a stockarea closes everything in that stockarea (no landings of GB Cod if GB haddock is closed)
      #  EconType=Single --> a closure in a stockarea does not close everything in that stockarea ( landings of GB Cod allowed if GB haddock is closed) 
      #  CatchZero ==TRUE --> no catch of GB Cod if GB cod is closed
      #   CatchZero ==FALSE --> catch of GB Cod happens even if GB cod is closed (but all catch would be discarded).
      # LandZero is unused.


# NEEDS: 
  # check/verify that closing fisheries for jointness is coded properly.

#added pre-processing code here for validation and counterfatual scenarios
